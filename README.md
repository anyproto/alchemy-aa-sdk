# Alchemy Account Abstraction (AA) SDK for Golang
This Golang library features basic functions to interact with Alchemy's AA endpoint.

## What is AA?
Account Abstraction ([ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io)) is a great approach to interacting with smart contracts in the Ethereum-compatible chains. It postulates and proposes how modern wallets should be built, how transactions should be sent and how smart contract systems should be designed.

Account Abstraction moves crypto from the current approach of a simple EOA account, where one can lose everything with a small mistake, to a future where an account can be tailored to their needs using smart contracts.

The shift from EOAs to smart contract wallets with arbitrary verification logic paves the way for a series of improvements to wallet designs, as well as reducing complexity for end users.

Please see [a very good introduction to AA by Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com//blog/account-abstraction).

## Alchemy
